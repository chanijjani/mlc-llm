    Answer[1, 5]: MessageData(role=Bot, text=**Response 1:**

    > I thought the Oscars were an incredible event. The cinematography was stunning, and the acting performances were exceptional. I especially enjoyed Michelle Yeoh's win for Best Actress. It was a truly unforgettable night!

    **Response 2:**

    > I found the Oscars to be a bit overrated this year. While some impactful films like "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and "The Whale" made an appearance, there seemed to be a lack of diversity in terms of themes and narratives. It felt like the same old Hollywood formula repeated with some superficial changes.

    **Response 3:**

    > The Oscars were a mixed bag for me this year. While I enjoyed some performances, particularly Brendan Fraser's comeback story, other films struggled to capture my attention or left me indifferent. It's good to see awards recognition for diverse voices and stories, but I hope next year's Oscars are more curated and impactful across the board.**, id=6283119f-97c5-4db5-ad1a-3b98e7ad1129), Performance: prefill: 15.0 tok/s, decode: 6.9 tok/s
