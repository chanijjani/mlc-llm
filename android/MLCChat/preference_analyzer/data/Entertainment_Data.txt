
Alex: Did you guys watch the Oscars last night? That was one of the best shows in years!


Ryan: I did! I can’t believe Everything Everywhere All at Once swept so many categories. It deserved every win, though. What a wild movie!


Sarah: Totally! Michelle Yeoh winning Best Actress was everything. She made history, and her speech gave me chills. She’s such a legend.


Jason: Yeah, her speech was powerful. And Ke Huy Quan winning Best Supporting Actor? I’m still emotional over that. His journey from child actor to Oscar winner is so inspiring.


Emily: I loved how he thanked his mom! And when he reunited with Harrison Ford on stage, my heart melted. It was like an Indiana Jones moment all over again!


Alex: Right?! And I’m so happy Brendan Fraser won Best Actor for The Whale. His comeback story is incredible. I was rooting for him all the way.


Ryan: Fraser’s win was one of the highlights for me too. It was his moment, and you could tell how much it meant to him. The guy’s been through a lot, and now he’s an Oscar winner!


Sarah: And can we talk about the performances? Lady Gaga’s “Hold My Hand” was beautiful. She stripped it down and just let her voice shine.


Jason: Gaga was great, but I also loved Rihanna’s performance. “Lift Me Up” hit all the emotional notes. Her voice is so powerful, and seeing her pregnant on stage was such a moment!


Alex: The Oscars really delivered this year. We should make it a tradition to watch together! Next year’s awards night could be even bigger.
